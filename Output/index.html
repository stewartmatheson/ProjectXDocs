  <h1>Before The Sun Comes Up</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Rouge-like, where the player takes on the role of an archetypical burglar. A game involves the player moving from house to house stealing loot. Scores for the game are based on how much the player can steal in a given game. At the end of the game, the player's score is reset, and they must start again. If a player is good enough, they will make it to the end of &quot;Henderson St&quot;(Working Name) and get a bonus added to their score. The player's game will end once they rob all the houses or get killed by the police. Players can also get killed by ghosts. Once a player is killed, they must restart the game and lose all their items.</p>
<h2>Cast</h2>
<ul>
<li>Robber: Grabber Dan. A portly man with a scar on his face and a 5 o'clock shadow. Could also smoke cigars.</li>
<li>Resident: Mrs Battersby, an elderly lady in a nightdress who lives at the house being robbed.</li>
<li>Various Ghosts.</li>
<li>Police complete with their bobby hats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Systems</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The following is a list that provides an overview of all the required systems for the game. See each system section for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>A tile Atlas for dealing with sprites and loading in animations.</li>
<li>A noise system where the player will have to remain quiet.</li>
<li>A room system that randomly generates new house layouts for each game.</li>
<li>A powerup system where the player can collect several items allowing them to rob more loot.</li>
<li>A. An AI system where ghosts and house residents attack the player. This will include police AI as well. See AI section</li>
<li>A loot system. This will control how much a player will score within a given game</li>
<li>A map editing system allowing for developers to design rooms while in the game</li>
</ul>
<p>As the player moves around the game, they lose health. A player starts with three points of health. If a player arrives zero health, they die, and their score is zero as they could not escape with any loot.</p>
<h3>House System</h3>
<p>The game will feature predefined houses. Houses will consist of interconnected rooms with furniture placed randomly in them. The furniture will act as containers. The player can then interact with the furniture by searching the furniture. This will cause the player to make noise; however, they will find their loot and powerups.</p>
<p>When moving from room to room, the viewport will scroll in much the same way that the legend of Zelda does. This will happen when a player comes in to contact with a door entity. See the maps section for more details on how entities work. Moving through doors will occur in three different phases. First, the player will come in contact with the door. At that point, the player entity controller will be swapped out with a door transition controller entity. This door transition controller entity will move the player through the door without any input from the player. Once the player has moved through the door, the screen viewport will be scrolled to the next room. At this point, the door transition controller will move the player out into the next room. At that point, the door transition controller will be removed, and the player will regain control.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>
<p>The game will feature a noise system. Making noise will attract unwanted attention to the player and may get them caught.</p>
<h3>Power-ups</h3>
<p>A list of powerups the player can get</p>
<ul>
<li>Night Vision Goggles</li>
<li>Sneakers... for sneaking. Helps the player make less noise. These will reduce the effectiveness of the hearing sensors of ghosts</li>
<li>Gloves allows for searching containers more quickly.</li>
<li>Weapons, which will allow the player to more efficiently fight both police and ghosts.</li>
<li>PK Flux: A special agent that will soothe the aggressiveness of ghosts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loot</h3>
<p>The loot system will determine the players' final score in a given game. As the player moves through the house, they collect different items. Each item has values, with more challenging to get items having more value. An item's value can only be claimed once the player exists safely from a given house through any kind of exit point. If a player dies, all loot currently being held will be lost and not added to the player's score.</p>
<h3>Maps</h3>
<p>Maps will consist of both a tiling system as well as placed entities. The tiling system will allow rooms to be drawn by putting square tiles in a grid formation.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<h3>Entites</h3>
<p>Entities describe any game object that exists on the map. Entities can be either static or move around the map. The entity class has an optional controller member that will allow it to move. If no controller member for the entity is defined, it will be considered static. Entities also can collide by defining hitboxes. If an entity does not specify a hitbox, then there will be no collision. Some tiles can be marked as walls. In this case, both a tile and an entity with no sprite are placed on the map.</p>
<h4>Types of Entities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Doors. Doors connect two different rooms. See house system for more details on how doors work.</li>
<li>Enemies. Enemies can be placed anywhere in a room. Each time the room is loaded, the enemies will be reset to their original positions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bots</h3>
<ul>
<li>As well as enemies, bots are placed around the house. These bots are activated conditionally and can move from room to room.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I don't know... Because. To learn C++. To make a fun game. Stop asking me so many questions.</p>
