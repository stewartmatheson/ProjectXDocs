ProjectX will be a pixel game. ProjectX will have a top-down view like "A Link to The Past" for SNES. Houses will range from American-style trailers to ornate mansions. The main player will wear a striped shirt and have a black mask. The resident of the house will always be the same old lady in her nightdress.
